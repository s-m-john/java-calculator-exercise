# Roman Numerals Kata

Write a method `String convert(int)` that takes a number and converts it to its equivalent Roman numeral representation.


| Number | Roman |
| ----- | ------ |
|   1   |   I   |
|   2   |   II  |
|   3   |   III |
|   4   |   IV  |
|   5   |   V   |
|   9   |   IX  |
|   10  |   X   |
|   50  |   L   |

<u>**Tips**</u>

- Take small steps. 

- You should always be able to go to a green state (with all tests passing) quickly.

- Stick to the red, green and refactor steps.

- Try not to refactor in the red. If you write a failing test that would need a big rewrite to pass, consider removing the test, refactoring in the green, and then writing the test again.

- As you progress through the problem, you should see your algorithm start to evolve. In other words, as the tests get more specific, the code gets more generic.
Don't be afraid to let the code get a little bit messy - sometimes that's the best way to spot the next refactoring step.
